         <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Introduction </h2>
    <p> My name is Destiny Prater. I am a graduate student pursuing a Masters Degree in Seconday Education of Mathematics. I went to Western 
        Illinois University for my undergrad and have a Bachelors Degree in Law Enforcement and Justice Administration with a minor in Homeland 
        Security. I have two older sisters and two younger brothers. I have a three year old German Shorthaired Pointer, Maverick, and a one year 
        old nephew, Lane, who I spend most of my time chasing after. I am hoping to get another GSP later this year. </p>
        <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> What I Hope to Learn in This Course </h2>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li> Artificial Intelligence </li>
        <li> Functions </li>
        <li> Networks </li>
        <li> Security </li>
    </ul> </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> My Favority Hobby / Activity </h2>
    <p> My favorite acitvity is traveling. The place that I have visited the most is Ireland. My favorite place I have visited is Ireland, with 
        Denmark and Scotland tied for second. The trips I have planned for later in the year include Norway, Belgium, Poland, Greece, and the 
        Netherlands. But, out of all the countries I have visited I still have not been to Canada or Mexico. </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Fun Fact </h2>
    <p> A fun fact about me is that I recently did ancestry.com to find out more about my grandfather on my mom's side of the family. In doing this, 
        I found out his entire side of the family was from Norway and I had a great great grandfather named Thor. My mom and I plan on visiting Norway 
        sometime this year and hope to see the area my grandfather's family came from. </p>
